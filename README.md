# MIT HST.936: Global health informatics to improve quality of care

This year, the focus will be on analysis of county-level excess mortality data that we have been collecting from the various state health departments. The data was aggregated from death certificates in each county from 2015 - 2020. We have been linking this data with mobility data, population census, outbreak dashboards, hospital and ICU census, Media Cloud news articles, etc. to better understand the drivers of excess mortality during the pandemic.
