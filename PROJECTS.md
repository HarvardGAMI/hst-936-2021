## Project #1: Evaluating COVID-19-Induced Excess Mortality at the County-Level in the United States

### Keywords: 
biostatistics, causal inference, natural language processing

### Context: 
COVID-19 has led to increased morbidity and mortality among older populations and those with underlying health conditions, but also among those who are unable to access outpatient and emergency services because of the lockdown and surge in acute care demand. As an example, in Colorado, the decrease in fatal road and work accidents associated with stay-at-home orders did not make up for the COVID-19-related deaths, and excess mortality from February through July was estimated at 60 per 100k (25 attributed to COVID-19), an 18% increase compared to 2015-2019. Explaining the underlying causes of death, and assessing the geographical heterogeneity of the excess death toll within the state, require careful retrospective analysis of death certificates, including job occupation, industry, and education level information. To that end, we have contacted departments of health across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We have collected county-level all-cause mortality data for 15 states, and are about to conclude additional partnerships with local departments. Additionally, we compiled news articles from the Media Cloud state-level media aggregator that had specific county mentions since March 1, 2020. Deriving additional insights from infoveillance tools may help provide the narrative behind excess death calculation from COVID-19 at the county level in the US.

### Project focus: 
The challenge is to develop a causal-mediation analysis framework to assess: (a) the direct effect of underlying demographics, population health, and county infrastructure onto COVID-19-induced excess mortality; (b) the indirect contribution of mobility on COVID-19 mortality and non-COVID-19 excess deaths, by integrating inter-county mobility data from PlaceIQ, Unacast, SafeGraph, and Facebook. 

### Are you interested? 
We are looking for students interested in interdisciplinary research, with a background in statistics, natural language processing, and/or network science. Knowledge of Python is required; experience in epidemiology is not required but a plus.

## Project #2: Mobility Networks

### Title: 
Modeling mobility networks across US counties and states

### Keywords: 
mobility networks, data visualization, biostatistics

### Context: 
The movement of people within the US has relevance to many fields including economics, epidemiology, policy-making, and infrastructure development. However, analysis of mobility has never been more important that in the era of COVID where major outbreaks of the disease have been caused by inter-state and inter-county travel of infected peoples.

### Project Focus: 
In this project, you will leverage PlaceIQ county-to-county mobility data to quantify the temporal evolution of the mobility network for each state in the US. Thanks to a data collection effort led by Dr. Yuan Lai in DUSP, the team has gathered information about the flow of persons (edges or links) between US counties (nodes) since the beginning of 2020. Using visualization tools, you will represent the evolution of each state’s interaction network over time. Additionally, you will use network science metrics to estimate the evolution of each state’s network characteristics (e.g., density, diameter). We would encourage you to combine additional mobility data sources (e.g., Apple, Google, Unacast, Facebook, SafeGraph) to enrich the mobility knowledge graph. If time permits, the team could explore how the network characteristics relate with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, characterizations of social structures through the Facebook Social Connectedness Index, as well as excess mortality in each state.

### Are you interested? 
We are looking for students interested in interdisciplinary research, with a background in data visualization in Python (matplotlib, seaborn, etc.). Knowledge of Python is required; experience in procession mobility data will be nice.

## Project #3: Profession job occupation understanding

### Title: Association of COVID-19 Excess Mortality with Job Occupation and Outbreak Centers

### Keywords: biostatistics, machine learning, infodemiology

### Context: 
The risk for developing COVID-19 is different not only across race, ethnicity, income, education levels, etc. but also across different job occupations. For example, preliminary research has shown that cooks, packaging workers, construction workers, and others have had a higher risk of dying from COVID-19 (here’s a paper that did this for california)

### Project Focus: 
1) Job occupation is listed as part of the death certificates that we have received from certain states. We have been in touch with the CDC NIOCCS where we would like their expertise on how to match free text describing both job occupation and industry fields to an established category. They have invited us to beta test NIOCCS v4, which uses ML techniques instead of a rule-based process to map job occupation names to a broader job category and industry sector, and have shared some code to help get started. 2) In our work in Colorado thus far, we have looked at outbreaks in food processing and meatpacking areas, along with jails and nursing homes. How might we examine nontraditional data sources, such as news articles from MIT media cloud to gain insight into particular outbreaks that impacted certain occupations?

### Are you interested? 
We are looking for students interested in interdisciplinary research, with a background in classic machine learning techniques and large-scale data processing. Knowledge of Python or R is required.

## Project #4: Vulnerability Indices

### Title: Excess Mortality and its link to Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and CCVI

### Keywords: 
mobility networks, data visualization, biostatistics

### Context: 
Coronavirus has taken a major toll on the US, but the full extent of its damage is not yet known. Understanding the extent of undercounting, and how it varies in different parts of the country is key to developing evidence-based solutions for fighting the pandemic and reopening the country. Measuring “excess deaths,” or the number of deaths above the average recorded for the same period in previous years, can provide a window onto the true toll of coronavirus. In order to estimate excess deaths, MIT and Surgo have identified the need for timely reporting of deaths at the local level. 

### Project Focus: 
Our teams plan to link excess deaths data to relevant datasets such as Surgo’s COVID Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI) to better understand the factors driving patterns in excess mortality. Doing analysis at the local county level will provide policymakers with the tools and precision needed to make important public health decisions in the coming months. Students would explore both the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) from the CDC along with the CCVI to examine disparities in the impact of the virus among the most vulnerable in addition to county-level epidemiologic factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. If time permits, students will attempt to create a vulnerability index based on excess mortality data.

### Are you interested? 
We are looking for students interested in interdisciplinary research, with a background in classic machine learning techniques, large-scale data processing, and experience with census variables (race, ethnicity, income, education, occupation, etc.). Knowledge of Python or R is required.

## Project #5: Extension of excess mortality to all 50 States
